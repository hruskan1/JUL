# But you can change variable value in REPL -Julia acts differently in REPL and script 
# -> desire to utilize REPL as Interactive enviroment as in Matlab. On the other hand, it is careful with namespace 
# See julia:worksapce panel in vscode

# We have reserved words
#struct = [] # syntax error

# Arithmetic
x = 4.3
y = 2.2

print(x √∑ y,'\n') # integer division (works also for floats, like y = 2.5)

print(x / y,'\n') # classical float division
print(x \ y,'\n') # inverse divison y/x
print(x * y,'\n')
print(x ^ y,'\n')
